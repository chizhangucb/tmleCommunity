Description: Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) of the average causal effect of 
    community-based intervention(s) at a single time point on an individual-based outcome of 
    interest. It provides three approaches to analyze hierarchical data: community-level TMLE, 
    inidividual-level TMLE and stratified TMLE. Implementations of the inverse-probability-of-
    treatment-weighting (IPTW) and the G-computation formula (GCOMP) are also available for 
    each approach. The package supports multivariate arbitrary interventions (deterministic 
    or stochastic) with a binary or continuous outcome. The tmleCommunity() function calculates 
    the marginal treatment effect among independent community units (or i.i.d individual units 
    if no hierarchical structure) using TMLE. Besides, it allows user-specified data-adaptive 
    machine learning algorithms through SuperLearner and h2oEnsemble packages. The input dataset 
    should be made up of rows of community-specific and individual-specific observations, with 
    each row i (in community j) containing random variables (W_{i,j}, E_j, A_j, Y_{i,j}), where 
    E_j represents a vector of community j's environmental baseline covariates, W_{i,j}represents
    a vector of individual i's individual-level baseline covariates, A_j is the exposure(s) 
    (can be univariate or multivariate, can be binary, categorical or continuous) assigned or 
    naturally occurred in community j and Y_{i,j} is i's outcome (either binary or continuous). 
    More details can be found in '?tmleCommunity-package' and '?tmleCommunity'.
