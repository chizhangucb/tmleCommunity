Description: Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) of the average causal effect of community-based intervention(s) at a single time point on an individual-based outcome of interest. Implementations of the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and the G-computation formula (GCOMP) are also available. The package supports multivariate arbitrary interventions (deterministic or stochastic) with a binary or continuous outcome. The tmleCommunity() function calculates the marginal treatment effect among independent community units (or i.i.d individual units if no hierarchical structure) using TMLE. Besides, it allows user-specified data-adaptive machine learning algorithms through SuperLearner and h2oEnsemble packages.
