#' Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Community-level Data
#'
#' Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) for the sample average community-based treatment specific means effects (and can be  
#'  extended to additive treatment effect) in community-independent data structures. In other words, it estimates the marginal treatment  
#'  effect of single-time point arbitrary interventions on a continuous or binary outcome in community-independent data, adjusting for
#'  both community-level and individual-level baseline covariates. The package also provides Inverse-Probability-of-Treatment-Weighted 
#'  estimator (IPTW) and parametric G-computation formula estimator (GCOMP). The statistical inference (Standard errors, t statistc, 
#'  p-value and confidence intervals) of both TMLE and IPTW are based on the corresponding influence curve, respectively. Optional 
#â€˜  data-adaptive estimation of exposure and outcome mechanisms using the SuperLearner package and h2o package (latter for a large 
#'  dataset) is strongly recommended, especially when the outcome mechanism and treatment mechnism are unknown. Besides, it allows 
#'  for panel data transformation, such as with random effects and fixed effects. 
#' 
#' The input dataset should be made up of rows of community-specific and individual-specific observations, for community \eqn{j}, each  
#'  row \eqn{i} includes random variables \eqn{(W_{i,j}, E_{j}, A_{j}, Y_{i,j})}, where \eqn{E_j} represents a vector of community 
#'  \eqn{j}'s community-level (environmental) baseline covariates (individuals within the same community share the same values of 
#'  \eqn{E_j}), \eqn{W_{i,j}} represents a vector of individual \eqn{i}'s individual-level baseline covariates, \eqn{A_j} is the 
#'  exposure(s) (can be univariate or multivariate, can be binary, categorical or continuous) assigned or naturally occurred in  
#'  community \eqn{j} (individuals within the same community receive the same value of \eqn{A_j}) and \eqn{Y_{i,j}} is \eqn{i}'s 
#'  outcome (either binary or continuous). Each individual's baseline covariates \eqn{(W_{i,j}} depends on the environmental 
#'  baseline covariates \eqn{E_j} of the community \eqn{j} to which \eqn{i} belongs to. Similarly, each community's exposure 
#'  \eqn{A_j} depends on its community-level baseline covariates \eqn{E_j} and individual-level baseline covariates of all 
#'  individuals belonging to community \eqn{j} (all \eqn{W_{i,j}} such that \eqn{i} belongs to \eqn{j}). Besides, each outcome 
#'  \eqn{Y_{i,j}} could be affected by its baseline community and individual-level covariates \eqn{(E_j, W_{i,j})} and the baseline
#'  covariates of other individuals within the same community \eqn{(W_{s,j}: s\neq i, s\in j)}, together with its community-based
#'  intervention \eqn{A_j}. We note that the input data with no hierarchical structure (i.e., no communities and only individuals)
#'  is a special case of the hierarchical data since it simply treats \eqn{E_j} as \code{NULL}. 
#' 
#'  There are currently three approaches that can be used in hierarchical data analysis. The first community-level TMLE is developed 
#'  under a non-parametric causal model that allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a community. It estimates  
#'  the community-level causal effect by aggregating data at a community-level and treating community rather than the individual as 
#'  the unit of analysis (i.e., both community-level outcome and treatment mechanisms). The second individual-level TMLE is developed 
#'  under the submodel of the causal model in the first approach, incoporating knowledge of the dependence structure between 
#'  individual within communities (i.e., both individual-level outcome and treatmnet mechanisms). The third stratified TMLE fits a 
#'  separate outcome (exposure) mechanism for each community, and then combine those estimates into a (user-specific) average 
#'  (Default to be community size-weighed). Note that the stratified TMLE naturally controls for the community-level observed  
#'  covariates and unobserved factors. Namely, there is no \eqn{E} in the regressors for both outcome and treatment mechanisms.

#' An Example of a Hierarchical Data Containing a Cluster-Based Binary Exposure with a Individual-Level Binary Outcome.
#'
#' Simulated hierarchical dataset containing 1000 independent communities, each (community \eqn{j}) containing \eqn{n_j} (non-fixed) 
#'  number of individuals where \eqn{n_j} is drawn from a normal with mean 50 and standard deviation 10 and round to the nearest 
#'  integer. Each row (observation) includes 2 measured community-level baseline covariates (\code{E1, E2}), 3 dependent   
#'  individual-level baseline covariates (\code{W1, W2, W3}), 1 dependent bianry exposure (\code{A}) and 1 dependent binary outcoem 
#'  (\code{Y}), along with one unique community identifier (\code{id}). The community-level baseline covariates (\code{E1, E2}) 
#'  were sampled as i.i.d across all communities, while the individual-level baseline covariates (\code{W1, W2, W3}) for each 
#'  individual \eqn{i} within communty \eqn{j} was generated conditionally on the values of \eqn{j}'s community-level baseline 
#'  covariates (\code{E1[j], E2[j]}). Then the community-level exposure (\code{A}) for each community \eqn{j} was sampled 
#'  conditionally on the value of \eqn{j}'s community-level baseline covariates (\code{E1[j], E2[j]}), together with all 
#'  invididuals' baseline covariates (\code{W1[i], W2[i], W3[i]}) within community \eqn{j} where \eqn{i=1,..,n_j}. Similary, 
#'  the individual-level binary outcome \code{Y} for each individual \eqn{i} within communty \eqn{j} was sampled conditionally 
#'  covariates and exposure (\code{E1[j], E2[j], A[j]}), as well as the value of individual \eqn{i}'s baseline covariates 
#'  on the value of community \eqn{j}'s baseline (\code{W1[i]}, \code{W2[i]}, \code{W3[i]}). The following section provides more

#' An Example of a Non-Hierarchical Data Containing a Binary Exposure with a Rare Binary Outcome (Independent Case-Control)
#'
#' Simulated (non-hierarchical) dataset containing 2,000 i.i.d. observations, with each row \code{i} consisting of 4 measured baseline 
#'  covariates (\code{W1}, \code{W2}, \code{W3} and \code{W4}), 1 binary exposure (\code{A}) and 1 binary outcome (\code{Y}) that
#'  defines case or control status. The baseline covariates \code{W1}, \code{W2}, \code{W3} and \code{W4} were sampled as i.i.d., 
#'  while the exposure \code{A} for each observation \code{i} depends on \code{i}'s four baseline covariates. Similarly, the outcome
#'  \code{Y} for each observation depends on \code{i}'s baseline covariates and exposure values. Moreover, we can also describe the 
#'  case-control design as first sampling \eqn{1} case \eqn{(W_1^1, W_2^1, W_3^1, W_4^1, A^1)} from the conditional distribution of 
#'  \eqn{(W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, A)}, given Y = 1. One then samples \eqn{J} controls \eqn{(W_1^{0,j}, W_2^{0,j}, W_3^{0,j}, 
#'  W_4^{0,j}, A^{0,j})} from \eqn{(W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, A)}, given Y = 0, \eqn{j=1,...,J}. Thus, the cluster containing one case 
#'  and \code{J} controls is considered the experimental unit. Finally one gets \eqn{nC} cases and \eqn{nCo} controls with 
#'  \eqn{J=nC/nCo}, where \eqn{J} can be used effectively in observation weights. The following section provides more details
